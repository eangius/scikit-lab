[![stability-beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-orange.svg)]()


### Documentation
Latest documentation lives [here](https://eangius.github.io/scikit-lab).


### Installation
Until this project matures beyond experimentation, we omit publishing an official
[PyPi](https://pypi.org) package. The package can still be installed & used in your
projects installed via `pip` package managers or `requirements` files as follows:

```shell
pip install git+git://github.com/eangius/sckit-lab.git;
```

```requirements.txt
scikit-lab @ git+git://github.com/eangius/sckit-lab.git@main
```


### Development
Most local development operations within this project are
simplified by the `./run` helper script.
