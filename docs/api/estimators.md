# Estimators

These are pipeline components that learn from vectorized input `X` & predict a target `y`.
In most cases estimators live at the end of the pipeline, but somtimes estimators can be used
as features within other models. The main types of estimators are:

| TYPE        | DESCRIPTION                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| clusterers  | predict or triage data into groups |
| classifiers | predict an enumerated value        |
| regressors  | predict a continuous value         |
