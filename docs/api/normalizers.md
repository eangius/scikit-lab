# Normalizers

These are pipeline components that transform the input format or content while
preserving their original domain semantics. Think of normalizers as necessary
pre-processors that standardize data for downstream steps. Some conceptual examples
of normalizers can include: ``ValueScaler`` for numerical ranges,
``LanguageTranslator`` for written texts, or even ``CurrencyConverter``
for monetary values.
